NAME
    `Protocol::CassandraCQL' - wire protocol support functions for Cassandra
    CQL

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides the basic constants and other support functions
    required to communicate with a Cassandra database using `CQL'. It is not
    in itself a CQL client; it simply provides the necessary support
    functions to allow one to be written. It supports the additions added by
    `CQL' version 2.

    For a complete client, see instead Net::Async::CassandraCQL.

CONSTANTS
    The following families of constants are defined, along with export tags:

  FLAG_* (:flags)
    Bitmask of flags used in message frames.

  OPCODE_* (:opcodes)
    Opcodes used in message frames.

  QUERY_* (:queryflags)
    Flag constants used in `OPCODE_QUERY' frames.

  BATCH_* (:batches)
    Type constants used in `OPCODE_BATCH' frames.

  RESULT_* (:results)
    Result codes used in `OPCODE_RESULT' frames.

  ROWS_* (:rowflags)
    Flag constants used in `RESULT_ROWS' frames.

  TYPE_* (:types)
    Type codes used in `TYPE_ROWS' and `TYPE_PREPARED' column metadata.

  CONSISTENCY_* (:consistencies)
    Consistency levels used in `OPCODE_QUERY' and `OPCODE_EXECUTE' frames.

FUNCTIONS
  ( $version, $flags, $streamid, $opcode, $body ) = parse_frame( $bytes )
    Attempts to parse a complete message frame from the given byte string.
    If it succeeds, it returns the header fields and the body as an opaque
    byte string. If it fails, it returns an empty list.

    If successful, it will remove the bytes of the message from the `$bytes'
    scalar, which must therefore be mutable.

  ( $version, $flags, $streamid, $opcode, $body ) = recv_frame( $fh )
    Attempts to read a complete frame from the given filehandle, blocking
    until it is available. If an IO error happens, returns an empty list.
    The results are undefined if this method is called on a non-blocking
    filehandle.

  $bytes = build_frame( $version, $flags, $streamid, $opcode, $body )
    Returns a byte string containing a complete message with the given
    fields as the header and body.

  send_frame( $fh, $version, $flags, $streamid, $opcode, $body )
    Sends a complete frame to the given filehandle.

  $consistency = lookup_consistency( $name )
    Returns the `CONSISTENCY_*' value for the given name (without the
    initial `CONSISTENCY_' prefix).

  $name = typename( $type )
    Returns the name of the given `TYPE_*' value, without the initial
    `TYPE_' prefix.

TODO
    *       Reimplement Protocol::CassandraCQL::Frame in XS code for better
            performance.
